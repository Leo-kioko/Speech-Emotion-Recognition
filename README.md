# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition project aims to develop a system capable of automatically detecting emotions from speech signals. 
•	Speech Emotion Recognition project aims to develop a system capable of automatically detecting emotions from speech signals. We start by collecting a dataset of speech samples labeled with corresponding emotions. Preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standardize the audio data. 
•	Feature extraction methods such as MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) are used to capture relevant information from the speech signals. Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are trained on the extracted features to classify emotions.  
•	The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score to assess its performance. We then fine-tune the model and optimize hyperparameters to improve its accuracy. Finally, we deploy the trained model into a real-world application where it can accurately recognize emotions in speech in real time.
•	This Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project outlines a comprehensive approach to detecting emotions from speech signals.
Here’s a breakdown of the process: \
a)	 Dataset Collection: Speech samples are gathered and labeled according to corresponding emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.  
b)	Preprocessing: The raw audio data undergoes preprocessing to clean and standardize it, ensuring better performance in later stages. Techniques may include noise reduction, normalization, and trimming silence.  
c)	Feature Extraction:  MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients): These features are commonly used in speech recognition, capturing both the power spectrum of the audio signal and the perceptual aspects of speech. Other possible features: Spectral contrast, Chroma features, Zero-crossing rate, etc. 
d)	Modeling:  SVM (Support Vector Machine): A classical machine learning algorithm suitable for smaller datasets. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): Suitable for sequential data, especially when modeling temporal dependencies in speech. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Can be used for capturing spatial features in spectrogram representations of audio signals. 
e)	Evaluation:  Accuracy: Measures how many predictions the model gets correct. F1-Score: Balances precision and recall, particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Fine-tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization: Adjusting the model’s hyperparameters (like learning rate, number of layers, etc.) to maximize its performance.  
f)	Deployment: Once trained and fine-tuned, the model can be deployed for real-time emotion detection in various applications like virtual assistants, customer service analytics, or mental health monitoring systems.
